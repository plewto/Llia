            <b>Gate</b> button. In gate mode the envelope cycles through the Attack,
            Decay1 and Decay2 segments and then holds at the Sustain level until the
            key is released.  Once the key is released the envelope immediately enters
            the Release stage regardless of it's current state.  
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            If Gate is disabled the envelope is in &#34;Trigger&#34; mode.  In trigger
            mode the envelope cycles through the Attack, Decay1, Decay2 and Release
            segments no matter how long the key is depressed.  The Sustain stage is
            skipped.

            Most envelope time sliders are non-linear.  This is a compromise between
            maximum possible time and resolution.  The sliders are finer-grained for
            short durations then for longer duration.

            A <i>Multi State Button</i> is a button which may be in two or more
            states. Left-clicking advances through the states, right-clicking moves to
            the previous state.  In most cases once the button reaches its
            final/initial state, further clicking wraps the state to the opposite end.

            In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation_synthesis">FM synthesis</a>
            an <em>operator</em> is an integrated oscillator and envelope
            generator. Operators may function either as a modulator or a carrier.
            Modulators do not directly contribute to the instruments output.  In
            practice operators may differ wildly in terms of the oscillator waveform
            (often sine wave only), envelope capabilities, and other modulation
            features, such as keyboard scaling, LFO, and velocity.

               No two synths will have the same SID and specifically no two synths will
               have the same serial number.   The serial number is useful in determining 
               the relative creation times of two synths.   Synths with higher serial number
               may serve as inputs to those with lower numbers, but not the other way around.

              The term <em>synth</em> is heavily overloaded.  On the client side synths
              come in three flavors:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Synth - a playable instrument, as in a synthesizer</li>
              <li>Effect - an audio processor such as a delay line or reverb</li>
              <li>Controller - a control rate processor or generator, such as an LFO</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p class="section-body">
               When used by itself the word &#34synth&#34; may apply to any one of
               these three usages, hopefully the context will make it clear which synth
               type is intended.
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
               SuperCollider defines another separate, but related, usage for the word 
               &#34;Synth&#34;.  Technically Llia synths are proxies for synth
               objects on the SuperCollider server.  Effect and Control synths
               correspond directly one-to-one with server sides synths.   Instrumental
               synths may correspond to several server side synths depending on key
               mode, voice count, and the number of notes playing.
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
              Fortunately for the most part these distinctions may largely be ignored.
              Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the term <em>synth</em> applies to 
              a Llia client side object and will be one of the three types above.

            A tumbler is a set of numeric <a href="#msb">multi state buttons</a>.  Left
            clicking any digit increments it, right-clicking decrements it.  Whenever a
            digit is incremented past 9 or decremented below 0, the digit wraps
            around.

            It would be nice to have the digits carry/borrow whenever they overflow.  At
            the moment they do not.

            Most audio amplitude values are set with a volume slider.  These sliders
            are calibrated in db and have non-linear response.
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            There are several distinct ranges.  For positive values the slider is
            discrete and may be either +3 or +6 db.  Roughly half of the slider is
            dedicated to the range 0db to -12db.  Below -12db the attenuation falls off
            at a quicker rate to -48db just above the bottom.   At the very bottom the
            attenuation is &#45;&infin;
