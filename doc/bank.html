            Each active synth has its own bank of 127 programs.  With exception of 
            <a href="midi.html">MIDI Performance</a> values programs are generally not
            compatible between different synth types.   The bank area is to the left of
            the editor window and is divided into several vertical areas.

            The terms "program" and "patch" are used interchangeably. </p>

            At the very top is an icon identifying the synth type.  Immediately to the
            right of the icon is an ID (called the "sid" in the code) which uniquely
            identifies each active synth.  The sid is mostly relevant for the
            scripting feature.  The numeric portion of the sid is useful for
            determining how two synths may be patched.   Synths which were created
            early will have lower sid values then later synths.  Thus a synth A may be
            processed by effect X, only if the sid value of A is greater then the sid of
            X.</p>

        <h4 class="heading">Programs List</h4>
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Immediately below the icon are buttons for operation on the bank as a whole.
            </p>
            
            
            <ul>
              <li><b>Open</b>, Read a bank data file.  Only files of the appropriate
                  type may be read.</li>
              <li><b>Save</b>, Save the current data bank to a file.  Bank files have
                  extensions matching the synth type converted to lower case.  The file foo
                  holding a MASA bank will have the name "foo.masa".</li>
             <li><b>Init</b>, initialize bank data.</li>
             <li><b>Rem</b>, enter optional remarks text for the bank.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Next comes a list box of the current bank contents.  The current program will
            be highlighted though it may be scrolled out of view.</p>
            
        <h4 class="heading">Extended Program Mode</h4>
            <p class="section-body">
            
            When using the PolyN and PoyRotate <a href="keymodes.html">keymodes</a> two
            additional widgets appear below the program list.
            </p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/bank/bank_002.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            
            When Extend is checked program changes transmit multiple programs to the
            server side <a href="synths.html">synths</a>.  The number in the spinner
            indicates how many programs are used.  In the image above, selecting program
            6 transmits programs 6,7,8, and 9 to the synth objects.  If the number
            of voices exceeded 4 the programs start over again at 6.
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            With extended mode each note played may use a different program.  The
            effect can be extreme or subtle.   When extended mode is enabled synth
            editor controls are disabled.  This is because it would not be clear
            exactly which program was being edited.

            <hr class="section-head" />
        <h4 class="heading">Performance Level Controls</h4>
            
            Below the listbox are Performance related buttons.<br>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Copy</b>, copy the current Performance to the clipboard.</li>
              <li><b>Paste</b>, paste the clipboard performance to the current
                 program. The change is not permanent until the program is saved.</li>
              <li><b>Fill</b>, copy the current Performance across a range of
                 programs.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr class="section-head" />
        <h4 class="heading">Program Level Controls</h4>
            
            Near the bottom are buttons related to individual Programs.<br>
            <ul>
               <li><b>Store</b>, save the current program to a slot in the bank.
                  Options are provided to select the save location, and to enter optional
                  remarks text.</li>
               <li><b>RND</b>, Generates a random patch.  Not all synths support random
                   patch generations.   The generated program is stored to slot 127.</li>
               <li><b>Init</b>, Initialize the current patch.</li>
               <li><b>Copy</b>, Copy the current program to the clipboard.   The
                  clipboard is smart enough to keep track synth types and may hold several
                  programs simultaneously, but only one program each for each synth type.</li>
               <li><b>Paste</b>, Paste contents of clipboard to current program.  The
                   change is not permanent until the program is stored into the
                   bank.</li>
               <li><b>Lock</b>,  When selected the Lock checkbox disables program
                   changes. Both changes over MIDI and manual program selection are
                   disabled.  The lock function is to prevent certain effects, such as a
                   mixer, from changing every time the program does.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section-body">
            
            It is not obvious but there is a handle between the bank and editor
            sections to set the width of the bank display.</p>
