            A Performance is a collection of values related to how a synth responds to
            specific MIDI events.  In addition to synth parameter values each Program
            also contains a Performance.  Performances are stored in the <a
            href="bank.html">Program bank</a> along with Programs and are recalled the
            same as with Programs (either by MIDI program change or by direct user
            selection).  The types of things a performance specifies are:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li>Transposition</li>
            <li>Active key range</li>
            <li>Pitch bend range</li>
            <li>MIDI controller maps</li>
            <li>MIDI pitch wheel maps</li>
            <li>MID velocity maps</li>
            <li>MIDI aftertouch maps</li>
            <li>MIDI keynumber maps</li>
        </ul>
            <p class="section-body">
            Performance controls are spread across several tabs in an instrument
            editor.</p>

            Under the Performance tab there are 5 fields, two of these (MIDI channel
            and Key Table) are not actually part of the Performance.  They are placed
            here for lack of a better location.<br><br>
            
            <b>MIDI channel</b> selects the MIDI input channel.<br><br>
            
            <b>Key Table</b> selects which key table to use. <a href="keytable.html">key
            tables</a> define the relationship between MIDI key number and frequency and
            are used for alternate tunning. Currently only a few pre defined tables
            are available.  The table &#34;EQ12&#34; is the standard Western 12 note,
            equal tempered scale with A = 440Hz.<br><br>

            <p class="section-body">
            <b>Transpose</b> sets note transposition in MIDI key numbers.  Transpose may
            be up to &plusmn;36 semi-tones (3 octaves).</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            <b>Key Range</b> sets the active key range in terms of lower and upper MIDI
            key numbers.  Notes outside of this range are ignored.  The Key Range
            property is how instrument key splits might be defined.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            <b>Bend Range</b> sets pitch bend amount in terms of 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(music)">cents</a>  The maximum
            range is 2400 cents (2 octaves).</p>

        <h4 class="heading">Parameter Maps</h4>
            <p class="section-body">
            Several MIDI values may be mapped to synth parameters.
            Typical examples are mapping modulation wheel to vibrato or
            key velocity to filter cutoff.  With exception of MIDI continuous
            controllers, which are slightly more complex, all the mapping functions
            share a common interface.  The Map1 tab is for MIDI controllers and Pitch
            Wheel.  The Map2 tab contains Velocity, Aftertouch and Keynumber maps.
            All maps have the following values:
            </p>
            
        <ul>
            <li>Source signal</li>
            <li>Destination parameter</li>
            <li>Curve</li>
            <li>Curve modifier</li>
            <li>Range</li>
            <li>Limits</li>
        </ul>
            <p class="section-body">
            <b>Source signal</b> really only applies to MIDI controllers.  The
            source is implicit (Velocity, Keynumber etc) for the other control
            sources.  For MIDI controllers either the controller number is specified,
            or a symbolic name may be used, if they have been defined in the 
            <a href="config.html">config</a> file.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            <b>Destination parameter</b> is the synth parameter the source is mapped
            to.  Available parameters are provided in a drop down list.  The parameter
            names can at times be rather cryptic.  These names are usually not exact
            matches for the labels on the synth editors.  You can however always tell
            what the parameter (and current value) associated with an editor control is
            by moving the mouse over it.  The parameter and value will appear in the
            status line at the bottom of the editor window.</p>
            
            
            <p class="section-body">
               <b>Curve</b> selects the function used to map the source to the
               parameter value.  Possible curves are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Linear</li>
              <li>Exponential</li>
              <li>Logistic or &#34;S&#34;</li>
              <li>Step</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            <b>Curve Modifier</b> is a coefficient which modifies the curve
            in some way.   The exact effect is dependent on the curve type.
            For linear curves the modifier has no effect.  For exponential
            curves and the logistic curves the modifier alter the curve
            steepness.  For the exponential curve the modifier sign changes the
            curve concavity. A positive value produce a concave curve while
            negative values are convex. <b class="verify">or maybe its the
            other way around?</b>.  For the step curve the modifier sets the
            number of steps. Negative step counts alters the distribution to
            include the end points.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            <b>Range</b> sets the parameter range.   Many, but by no means all,
            parameters are &#34;normalized&#34; to take values between 0 and 1.   If
            the high and low values are inverted, such that low &gt; high, the the
            mapped curve will also be inverted.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            <b>Limits</b> sets an absolute limit on the parameter value. If the
            range is greater then the limit then some portion of curve will be
            clipped.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            You add a new parameter map by clicking the [+]
            button in the appropriate section.  Similarly a parameter map is
            removed by clicking [-].  When removing a mapping the special value
            &#34;ALL&#34; is be used to remove all maps from the give source.<br><br>
            
            In the case of keynumber the mapping function is aware of the
            current key range and takes that into account when calculating the parameter
            value. <br><br>
            
            Pitchwheel maps are in addition to the normal pitch bend functions. To
            defeat normal pitch bending set the bend range to 0.  Pitchwheel
            is the only source which may have a negative value.</p>
